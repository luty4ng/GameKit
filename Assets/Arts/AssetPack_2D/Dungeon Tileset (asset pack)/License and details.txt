Thanks for purchasing this dungeon pack!
Feel free to use it on any commercial or non-commercial game. You can not redistribute or resell this pack, though. Credit is not necessary, but very much appreciated (you can add a link to my Instagram/Twitter or itch page) :)

Included are all the tiles and spritesheets for each asset, in .png format, transparent background. You should be able to recreate anything you see on the example images.
The tiles are 16x16px.

All art was made by me (Franuka). If you need anything else, I'm open to commissions or long-term jobs. Ask for details.
